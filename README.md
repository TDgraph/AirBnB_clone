# AirBnB clone - The console


This is the first step towards building a first full web application: the AirBnB clone. This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration

# command interpreter or console
The console is very similar to shell except it is a single use function or command line interface which u can create, modify and delete objects in your file storage.
it can also be described as a sandbox where u can play around with objects and simply modify or delete what works or doesn't work in storage.
#  how to start it:
In order to start the console, you must use the following command: ./console.py

# How to used:
- manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interprete
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
- Commands: create, show, destroy, all (shows all), update, help, quit
### Example how to open:
```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$
```
